                        Hello, my name is Helen. I'm from Minas Gerais, Brazil, and I've been living in Portugal for over five years. During these past years, I've focused on my education in Portugal, and I currently reside in Viana do Castelo.

                        In <span className="highlight">2017</span>, I started developing websites as a freelancer using Elementor. I had already been deeply interested in programming, and during this period, I also worked as a graphic designer, creating visual identities and digital media creatives. In <span className="highlight">2018</span>, I landed my first job as a web designer, which solidified my decision to pursue this career path.
                    </p>

                        In <span className="highlight">2019</span>, I emigrated and spent some time away from the field I love so much. However, in <span className="highlight">2022</span>, everything changed when I began a UI/UX design course. In the same year, I started a course in Web and Multimedia Development and simultaneously enrolled in a Level 4 E-learning Computer Programmer course. It was a two-year journey, with my last year focused solely on gaining experienceâ€”details of which you can find in my CV. Since then, I have dedicated nearly a year to web design and web development projects.
